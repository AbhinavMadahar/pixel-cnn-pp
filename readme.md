A Pytorch Implementation of PixelCNN++.(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.05517.pdf)

Main work taken from the official implementation (https://github.com/openai/pixel-cnn)

Redid in Pytorch cuz why not. I kept the code structure to facilitate comparison with the official code. 

TODO : 

âœ“ fix logistic mixture loss

add multi gpu support

add TensorboardX support

make things more Pytorch-y
